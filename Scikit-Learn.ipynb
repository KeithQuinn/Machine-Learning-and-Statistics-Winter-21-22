    "Scikit-learn was initially developed by David Cournapeau as a Google summer of code project in 2007.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later Matthieu Brucher joined the project and started to use it as apart of his thesis work. In 2010 INRIA got involved and the first public release (v0.1 beta) was published in late January 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project now has more than 30 active contributors and has had paid sponsorship from INRIA, Google, Tinyclues and the Python Software Foundation.[1]"
