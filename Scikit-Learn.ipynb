    "Within the Python programming package there's a machine learning library known as scikit-learn. The scikit-learn library is integrated with other Python packages including NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and Pandas [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn was initially developed as a Google summer of code project in 2007 by David Cournapeau, then further developed by Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent Michel from the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation. The first public release was in January 2010 [2]. Many industries from engineering to banking to social media depend heavily on machine learning as part of their day to day operations and one of the most common tools used in the application of machine learning is the scikit-learn Python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many machine learning algorithms built into the scikit-learn library that can be used for many types of machine learning applications. In the following section of this notebook there's an overview of what machine learning followed by some worked examples. In these examples, algorithms from the scikit-learn package are used to train models on datasets, then analyse how the algorithms perform."

    "Machine Learning is becoming increasingly popular in recent times with the advancements in computer science and technology. However it's important to note that this ever evolving area of computer science is not a new phenomenon as it's been studied for decades. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of machine learning (ML) defined it as the “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”[4].In machine learning, algorithms are used to analyse data and in doing do look for patterns. The different data types that are analysed include but not limited to:\n",

Machine learning is so interesting and powerful because anything that can be digitally stored can be fed into a machine learning algorithm. Another interesting part of machine learning is how common it is, it's used on systems such as Netflix and YouTube to recommend what to watch, also on search engines such as Google and Social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook for advertising [5]. \n",

In unsupervised learning the model is given the unlabeled dataset and will try to learn some sort of structure or pattern from the data. Clustering Algorithms are commonly used in unsupervised learning. Take for example a dataset of peoples heights and weights for a given age are provided but the data isn't labeled male or female. The unsupervised clustering algorithm can start to cluster the data into groups potentially resulting in two distinct clusters which through inference it could be said that the groups are male and female [7].\n",

The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree [9]. The RandomForestClassifier() is used in this notebook along with the iris data set. A model is built that can predict the Iris class based on a never before seen set of inputs. \n",

The next section details machine learning and it's relationship to artificial intelligence and computer science. Where machine learning is used, how common it has become and how it's used on a daily basis across everything from streaming platforms to banks and social media is discussed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Technical aspects of machine learning such as the supervised and unsupervised approaches are discussed before looking at machine learning algorithms in scikit-learn. Three scikit-learn algorithms are then discussed and demonstrated:\n",

    "## 9) Conclusion\n",
    "***\n",
    "This assessment was really interesting, initially starting off it seemed really difficult. The concept of training a machine seemed like something only highly qualified and skilled programmers could do. Although initially it took some time to get an understanding of machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, it was an enjoyable learning experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest eye opening part of completing this assessment was the power of the scikit-learn library in Python and how intuitive and straight forward it is to use. Given a dataset and a couple of lines of code it's possible to train a machine to make predictions based on inputs it never seen before. I can only imagine the work and effort that went into creating and maintaining this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coolest thing about building the knowledge around machine learning and the scikit-learn package was that I was able to take some data from my workplace and train the machine to make a prediction. My plan is to present this to my colleagues in work and to show them the power of the scikit-learn package within Python."
