    "\n",
    "Within the Python programming package there's a machine learning library known as scikit-learn. The scikit-learn library is integrated with other Python packages including NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and Pandas [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn was initially developed as a Google summer of code project in 2007 by David Cournapeau, then further developed by Fabian Pedregosa, Gael Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort and Vincent Michel from the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation. The first public release was in January 2010 [1]. Many industries from engineering to banking to social media depend heavily on machine learning as part of their day to day operations and one of the most common tools used in the application of machine learning is the scikit-learn Python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many machine learning algorithms built into the scikit-learn library that can be used for many types of machine learning applications. In the following section of this notebook there's an overview of what machine learning is and the different elements of machine learning. Later in this notebook there's some worked examples of machine learning where datasets are used to train multiple algorithms to make predictions. In these examples, algorithms from the scikit-learn package are used."

In traditional computer science the programmer/developer writes the program line by line and provides the data for the program to run. In machine learning the programmer/developer gives the system the data and the output and trains the system to produce the program [7].\n",

    "Machine Learning is becoming increasingly popular in recent times with the advancements in computer science and technology. However it's important to note that this ever evolving area of computer science is not a new phenomenon as it's been studied for decades. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in the field of machine learning (ML) defined it as the “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed”[5].In machine learning, algorithms are used to analyse data and in doing do look for patterns. The different data types that are analysed include but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numbers \n",
    "* Words \n",
    "* Images \n",
    "* Clicks \n",
    "\n",
    "Through data analysis and statistics the machine learns, and based on past conditions it can make predictions about the future [2]. Machine learning is so interesting and powerful because anything that can be digitally stored can be fed into a machine learning algorithm. Another interesting part of machine learning is how common it is, it's used on systems such as Netflix and YouTube to recommend what to watch, also on search engines such as Google and Social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook for advertising [4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "With all these systems the machine is collecting data around film genres that interest you, the music you listen to, the products you buy, what links you click, what posts you like or dislike, based on this past behaviour the machine can predict with confidence about what movie you'd like to watch next, the song you'd like to listen to next, where you'll spend your money and where you won't spend your money[4]."

From Figure 1 it can be seen that labelled data was used to train the machine, the data was labelled as \"cats\" based on the algorithm the machine was able to predict correctly when presented with 4 animals, two of which were cats. The following sections will discuss in more detail supervised and unsupervised learning.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning means that the data in unlabeled meaning that it's impossible to pridict the accuracy of the model. In unsupervised learning the model is given the unlabeled dataset and will try to learn some sort of structure or pattern from the data. Clustering Algorithms are commonly used in unsupervised learning. Take for example a dataset of peoples heights and weights for a given age are provided but the data isn't labeled male or female. The unsupervised clustering algorithm can start to cluster the data into groups potentially resulting in two distinct clusters which through inference it could be said that the groups are male and female.\n",

In the following sections there are worked examples of each of the three algorithms. The algorithms selected for this notebook are:\n",

A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree [13]. The RandomForestClassifier() is used in this notebook along with the iris data set. A model is built that can predict the Iris class based on a never before seen set of inputs. \n",

    "#### 3.4) KNeighborsClassifier()\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other [14]."
