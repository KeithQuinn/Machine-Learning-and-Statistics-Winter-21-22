GitHub repository containing two Jupyter notebooks 1) Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook 2) Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook

# 1) Scikit-Learn Jupyter Notebook

This notebook starts out with an overview of the scikit-learn Python library; what it is, where it came from and where and why it is used. The following section details machine learning and it's relationship to artificial intelligence and computer science. Where machine learning is used, how common it has become and how it's used on a daily basis across everything from streaming platforms to banks and social media is discussed.

Technical aspects of machine learning such as the supervised and unsupervised approaches are discussed before looking at machine learning algorithms in scikit-learn. Three scikit-learn algorithms are then discussed and demonstrated:

* LinearRegression()
* RandomForestClassifier()
* KNeighborsClassifier()

With the introduction complete and some background on machine learning along with the selection of three scikit-learn algorithm the next section of the notebook provides some practical examples of each of the three algorithms.

* For the LinearRegression() algorithm the diabetes dataset and the Boston Housing dataset are used for demonstration.
* For the RandomForestClassifier() algorithm the Iris dataset along with a dataset obtained from my workplace are used for demonstration.
* For the KNeighborsClassifier() algorithm the breast-cancer-wisconsin dataset was used for demonstration.

# 2) Scipy Stats Jupyter Notebook

**Work in progress.**
